The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>\r
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 20 <br /><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200 <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended) <br /><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>\r
<p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>\r
<p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>\r
<p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p>\r

<p><em><br />* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards</em></p>\r
<p><strong>Balance.</strong> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>\r
<p><strong>Comet.</strong> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>\r
<p><strong>Donjon.</strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>\r
<p><strong>Euryale.</strong> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a &minus;2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>\r
<p><strong>The Fates.</strong> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>\r
<p><strong>Flames.</strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>\r
<p><strong>Fool.</strong> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>\r
<p><strong>Gem.</strong> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>\r
<p><strong>Idiot.</strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\r
<p><strong>Jester.</strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>\r
<p><strong>Key.</strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>\r
<p><strong>Knight.</strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>\r
<p><strong>Moon.</strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <strong>wish</strong>&nbsp;spell 1d3 times.</p>\r
<p><strong>Rogue.</strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <strong>wish</strong> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>\r
<p><strong>Ruin.</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\r
<p><strong>Skull.</strong> You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>\r

When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> (or <em>Dragon Orbs</em>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\r
<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\r
<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\r
<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\r
<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\r
<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\r
<h4>Random Properties</h4>\r
<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random properties:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r
<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\r
<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r
</ul>\r
<h4>Spells</h4>\r
<p>The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).</p>\r
<p>You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.</p>\r
<h4>Call Dragons</h4>\r
<p>While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>\r
<h4>Destroying an Orb</h4>\r
<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons.

<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder.

<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north.

<p>Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.</p>\r
<p>Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p>\r
<p>Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p>\r
<p>Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p>\r
<p>Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.</p>\r
<p>Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.</p>\r
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it.

<p>Ivory Goats  (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\r
<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\r
<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a lance, +1, and the other becomes a longsword, +2. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p>Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\r
<p>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>\r
<p>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>\r
<p>Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\r
<p>Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.</p>\r
<p>Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

<p>Reserve<strong> (Rare).</strong> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4&minus;1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>\r
<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>\r
<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>\r
<p>Strength<strong> (Very Rare).</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>\r

When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See the <span style="color: #bc0f0f;"><strong><a style="color: #bc0f0f;" title="Monsters Listing" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters">Monsters Listing</a></strong></span> for the creature's statistics. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\r
<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>\r
<p>Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r

<ul>\r
<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\r

<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <strong>lance, +1</strong>, and the other becomes a <strong>longsword, +2</strong>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.<br /><br /></li>\r

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The <em>apparatus of Kwalish</em> is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>\r
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 20 <br /><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200 <br /><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended) <br /> <strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>\r
<p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>\r
<p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>\r
<p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.</p>\r

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.</p>\r
<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</p>\r
<p>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can’t be divined.</p>\r
<p>Nature can’t abide the book’s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>\r
<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book’s contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</p>\r
<p>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to neutral evil.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can’t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> has the following random properties:</p>\r

<li>3 minor detrimental properties</li>\r
<li>2 major detrimental properties</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><strong><em>Adjusted Ability Scores.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Mark of Darkness.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Command Evil.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Dark Lore.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Dark Speech.</em></strong> While you carry the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\r
<p>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</p>\r
<p>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 &times; 100 years later.</p>\r
<p>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</p>\r

<p><strong>Vile Lore</strong></p>\r
<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> touches on every evil in the cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among the contents a character might find are the following, plus whatever else you choose:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li><strong>Vile Apotheosis.</strong> The book could hold a ritual that allows a character to become a lich or death knight.</li>\r
<li><strong>True Names.</strong> The true names of any number of fiends might be in the book.</li>\r
<li><strong>Dark Magic.</strong> Several spells of horrific evil of the DM’s design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile plagues, and so on.</li>\r

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn’t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\r
<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\r
<p>Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One’s will in the world.</p>\r
<p>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\r
<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\r
<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\r

You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM’s control.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Properties of the Hand.</strong></em> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>\r
<li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li>\r
<li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</li>\r

<li>You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can’t be [rule]surprise;surprised[/rule].</li>\r
<li>If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.</li>\r
<li>If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</li>\r
<li>You can use an action to cast wish. This property can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\r

This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna’s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.</p>\r
<p>For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas’s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich’s empire in Vecna’s stead. Legend says Vecna’s destruction came at Kas’s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant’s doom, leaving only Kas’s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Sword of Kas</em> is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.</p>\r
<p>If the sword isn’t bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage.

The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Sword of Kas</em> is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\r
<p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The sword’s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna’s worshipers, destroying the lich’s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Sword of Kas</em> also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword’s obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Destroying the Sword.</em></strong> A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the <em>Sword of Kas</em>.

<p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand’s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Call Undead.</strong></em> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don’t perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\r
<p>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The wand’s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus’s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.</p>\r
<p>In order to further its master’s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Wand.</strong></em> Destroying the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life&mdash;no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero’s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p>\r
<p>Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus’s layer of the Abyss.</p>`,price:-1,index:839},{name:"Blackrazor",source:"Dungeon Master’s Guide",canAttune:1,attunementDescription:"Creature of Non-Lawful Alignment",rarity:"Legendary",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/8777/167/637174480848372730.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/8777/168/637174480850179331.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Weapon",magic:1,description:`<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, <strong><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span></strong> shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars.

<p>Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.</p>\r
<p>Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p>\r
<p>Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p>\r
<p>Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p>\r
<p>Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.</p>\r
<p>Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.</p>\r
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.</p>`,index:850},{name:"Eye of Vecna",source:"Dungeon Master’s Guide",canAttune:1,rarity:"Artifact",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25122/350/637855687990993213.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25122/351/637855687992553066.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,description:`<p>Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice.

<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches.

The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p>\r
<p>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p>\r
<p>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb’s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Fire Orb.</strong></em> When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours.

At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.</p>\r

The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet &mdash; the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne’s powers are activated.</p>\r
<p>After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton’s throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne’s power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton’s leadership.</p>\r
<p>Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can’t be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.</p>\r
<p>Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic &mdash; the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne’s master.</p>\r
<p><strong>Properties of the Throne.</strong> The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne’s properties, which are as follows:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn’t expend any charges.</li>\r
<li>Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn’t expend any charges.</li>\r
<li>As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne’s blue dragon skulls.</li>\r
<li>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</li>\r
<li>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute.</li>\r
<li>At the end of each of the creature’s turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature’s choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon<span style="color: #bc0f0f;"><strong>’s</strong></span> bite and claw attacks.&nbsp;</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><strong>Destroying the Throne.</strong> The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can’t be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne’s destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>`,price:-1,index:1001},{name:"Mind Blade",source:"Homebrew / Unknown",canAttune:1,attunementDescription:"specific mind flayer or one of its thralls",rarity:"Rare",isHomebrew:0,filterType:"Weapon",magic:1,price:2e3,description:"<p>Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a mind blade.

<p><em><strong>The Forgotten One.</strong></em> The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff’s skull protects Acererak from this spirit’s vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff’s charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM’s control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a dispel evil and good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Staff.</strong></em> A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone’s guess.</p>\r
<p>Casting the staff into a sphere of annihilation destroys both the staff and the life force trapped within it.

Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon (see <a title="appendix B" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/monsters-and-npcs#MeloonWardragon">appendix B</a>), but the weapon is searching for a new owner.</p>\r
<p>Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.</p>\r
<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell’s barrier of magical force.</p>\r
<p>When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Hurling.</em></strong> The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Illumination.</em></strong> While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\r
<p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city’s defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.</p>\r
<p>If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can’t be wielded. Nothing short of a wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.</p>`,index:1138},{name:"Badge of the Watch",source:"Waterdeep: Dragon Heist",canAttune:1,attunementDescription:"someone designated by the Open Lord of Waterdeep",rarity:"Rare",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/4459/586/636708329753369693.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/4459/587/636708329754150949.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,price:3250,description:`<p>A <em>badge of the Watch</em> is given only to those who have earned the trust of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.

It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the <em>Blackstaff</em>, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see &ldquo;Personality&rdquo; below).</p>\r
<p>The <em>Blackstaff</em> has the magical properties of a staff of power (see the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>) in addition to the following properties.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Animate Walking Statues.</strong></em> You can expend 1 or more of the staff’s charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun’s spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see &ldquo;Personality&rdquo; below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong></em> You can expend 1 of the staff’s charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the <em>Blackstaff</em> before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Drain Magic.</strong></em> This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the <em>Blackstaff</em>, you can expend 1 of the staff’s charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Master of Enchantment. </strong></em>When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Blackstaff</em> is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff’s primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.</p>\r
<p>In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff’s wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor &mdash; someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Spirit Trap.</strong></em> When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can’t be raised from the dead.)</p>\r
<p>Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben’s spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben’s spirit has the staff’s Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben’s spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.</p>`,index:1140},{name:"Bracer of Flying Daggers",source:"Waterdeep: Dragon Heist",canAttune:1,rarity:"Rare",isHomebrew:0,filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,price:1e3,description:"<p>This armband appears to have thin daggers strapped to it.

<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the &ldquo;<a title="Artifacts" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#ArtifactProperties">Artifacts</a>&rdquo; section in chapter 7 of the <em><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\r
<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><strong><em>Legend Lore.</em></strong> The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.</p>\r
<p>By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can’t lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.</p>\r
<p>The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember’s secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Failed Memory.</em></strong> When your attunement to the <em>Stone of Golorr</em> ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see &ldquo;<a title="Sentient Magic Items" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts">Sentient Magic Items</a>&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the <em><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Destroying the Stone.</em></strong> While in stone form, the aboleth isn’t a creature and isn’t subject to effects that target creatures. The <em>Stone of Golorr</em> is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone’s remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone’s destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.</p>`,price:-1,index:1149},{name:"Blast Scepter",source:"Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage",canAttune:1,rarity:"Very Rare",isHomebrew:0,filterType:"Rod",magic:1,price:9500,description:`<p>The <em>Blast Scepter</em>&nbsp;can be used as an arcane focus.</p>\r

Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild’s headquarters and outposts. At the DM’s discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.</p>\r
<p>When you use an action to speak the item’s command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn’t enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn’t transform. See the<em> <i><a title="Monster Manual" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a></i></em> for the creature’s stat block &mdash; the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune’s description &mdash; unless you’re directed to <a title="chapter 6" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ggtr/friends-and-foes">chapter 6</a> of this source instead.</p>\r
<p>The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.</p>\r
<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can’t transform again until 36 hours have passed.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Azorius Keyrune (Rare).</strong></em> This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a giant eagle for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Boros Keyrune (Rare)</strong></em>. Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a veteran (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare).</strong></em> This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an intellect devourer that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it &mdash; usually an assignment to take over someone’s body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare).</strong></em> Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a giant scorpion for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Gruul Keyrune (Rare).</strong></em> This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.</p>\r

<p>The <em>living loot satchel</em> is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise’s funds and valuables. Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office’s vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise’s wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.</p>\r
<h4>Secret Satchel</h4>\r
<p>As a rank 3 hoardsperson, your <em>living loot satchel</em> gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the Leomund’s secret chest spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your <em>living loot satchel</em> to deposit or withdraw items&mdash;even items that wouldn’t normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don’t want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don’t want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.</p>\r
<h4>That Thing You Need</h4>\r
<p>At rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your <em>living loot satchel</em> and make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the <a title="Adventuring Gear table" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#OtherAdventuringGear">Adventuring Gear table</a> in chapter 5 of the <em><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>. The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.</p>\r
<h4>Portable Hole Satchel</h4>\r
<p>At rank 4, your <em>living loot satchel</em> receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a portable hole&mdash;6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the portable-hole-sized chest, even if it wouldn’t normally fit into your satchel.</p>\r
<h4>That Expensive Thing You Need</h4>\r

<h5>Whispered Encyclopedia</h5>\r
<p>At rank 2, your <em>whisper jar</em> becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check.

<h5>Read the Kill</h5>\r
<p>Also at rank 1, your <em>occultant abacus</em> not only tracks your franchise’s kills, it helps you determine the impact of those kills on the franchise’s fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add the d10 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it’s not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight.

<h5>Eldritch Occultant</h5>\r
<p>Starting at rank 2, your <em>occultant abacus</em> becomes an uncommon magic item that can track lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your <em>occultant abacus</em> within 5 feet of a creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the augury spell. The course of action you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This property of the <em>occultant abacus</em> can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r
<h5>Bring Out Your Dead</h5>\r
<p>Also at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r
<h5>Bead of Instant Karma</h5>\r
<p>At rank 3, one of the beads on your <em>occultant abacus</em> channels the power of instant karma, turning the <em>occultant abacus</em> into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your <em>occultant abacus</em> at the next dawn.</p>\r
<h5>Bead of Diverted Karma</h5>\r
<p>At rank 4, one of the beads on your <em>occultant abacus</em> allows you to divert karma to where it’s needed, turning the <em>occultant abacus</em> into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the d10 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your <em>occultant abacus</em> at the next dawn.</p>\r
<h5>Correct the Balance</h5>\r
<p>As a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature’s death, you can use your <em>occultant abacus</em> to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world.</p>\r
<p>If you fail the check, this property of the <em>occultant abacus</em> can’t be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can’t be used again until dawn seven days later.</p>`,price:-1,index:1312},{name:"Sending Stone",source:"Homebrew / Unknown",canAttune:0,rarity:"Uncommon",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6199/712/636951014926568552.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6199/713/636951014928131034.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,price:500,description:`<p>Also at rank 1, you are given use of an Acquisitions Incorporated <em>sending stone</em>, an uncommon magic item that resembles a gemstone in a bold setting.

You must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to establish contact. Once the stone is successfully used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r

<h5>Rumor Mill</h5>\r
<p>Also at rank 2, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your <em>sending stone</em>. These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions Incorporated or the organization’s many contacts.</p>\r
<h5>Improved Rumor Mill</h5>\r

<p>When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored on a small parchment card in the <em>portfolio keeper</em>. You can access the details of any such stored card as a bonus action.</p>\r
<h5>Cards of Sending</h5>\r
<p>At rank 3, the power of your <em>portfolio keeper</em> becomes more potent, making it a rare magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your <em>portfolio keeper</em>, you can choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your sending stone as if they had cast a sending spell. A business card loses this power seven days after it has been given out, and no more than five cards can have this power at one time.</p>\r
<p>You can also use your sending stone to cast sending and contact anyone who has one of your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.</p>\r

<p>Also at rank 4, you are able to make a focused effort to keep a potential customer’s attention.

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Orrery of the Wanderer</em>&nbsp;was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.</p>\r
<p>To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery’s instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again &mdash; and moving closer to each other all the time.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r
<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\r
<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p>The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>The Sum of Its Parts.</strong></em> Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:</p>\r
<p>The chronolometer<br />The dimensional loop<br />The far gear<br />The rotor of return<br />The timepiece of travel<br />The wheel of stars</p>\r
<p>Creatures can attune to the orrery’s components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn’t count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.</p>\r
<p>While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Future Echoes.</strong></em> With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Into the Void.</strong></em> With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Master of Travel.</strong></em> While all six components of the <em>Orrery of the Wanderer</em>&nbsp;are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): contact other plane (3 charges), demiplane (6 charges), gate (7 charges), plane shift (5 charges), or teleportation circle (3 charges).

<p><em><strong>Time Bandit.</strong></em> At the start of your turn, roll a d6 (no action required). On a 1&ndash;3, you slow down time, gaining an additional action on your turn and doubling your speed until the end of the turn. On a 4&ndash;6, you go forward in time to warn yourself of what is to come. The next time you fail a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can reroll the check and take either result.

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag’s curse.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Carrying Soul Coins.</strong></em> To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it &mdash; overcome with rage or fraught with despair.</p>\r
<p>An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Using a Soul Coin.</strong></em> A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:</p>\r
<p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</p>\r
<p><strong>Query.</strong> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Freeing a Soul.</strong></em> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.</p>\r
<p>A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine’s furnace (see "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/infernal-war-machines#SoulFuel">Soul Fuel</a>").</p>\r
<p>Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Hellish Currency.</strong></em> Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.</p>\r
<p>Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p>`,index:1332},{name:"Sword of Zariel",source:"Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus",canAttune:1,attunementDescription:"creature the sword deems worthy",rarity:"Artifact",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6757/71/637006868715445155.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6757/72/637006868716587825.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Weapon",magic:1,description:`<p>This longsword belonged to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace.

<p><em><strong>Attunement.</strong></em> The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest.

Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. Your alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Holy Light.</strong></em> The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword’s light disconcerting and painful, even if they can’t see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon’s radius of bright light.</p>\r
<p>As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword’s light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties, each determined by rolling on the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#MinorBeneficialProperties">Minor Beneficial Properties</a> table in chapter 7 of the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Searing Radiance.</strong></em> The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you’re wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Sword of Zariel</em> is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.</p>\r
<p>The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Truth Seer.</strong></em> While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Sword.</strong></em> Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn’t bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it’s used to shatter the Companion (see &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/escape-from-avernus#ShatteringtheCompanion">Shattering the Companion</a>&rdquo;), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.</p>\r

<p>While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Shield of the Hidden Lord</em> is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:</p>\r

<li>The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.</li>\r
<li>The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</li>\r
<li>Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can’t use it again until the next dawn.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Gargauth’s Personality.</strong></em> Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can’t escape on its own. The pit fiend won’t reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.</p>\r
<p>While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield’s current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual’s soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield’s owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.</p>\r
<p>Gargauth doesn’t know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it’s brought to the Nine Hells, for it’s convinced that the shield’s powers are weaker there.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Freeing Gargauth.</strong></em> Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth’s name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.</p>`,index:1336},{name:"Battle Standard of Infernal Power",source:"Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus",canAttune:1,rarity:"Very Rare",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6765/739/637007681780524097.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/6765/740/637007681781852219.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,price:6e3,description:`<p>This hell-forged battle standard is made of infernal iron and fitted with a small, unopenable cage containing a quasit.

<p>A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay.</p>\r
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage.</p>\r
<p>In addition, the weapon has the following properties:</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Blighted Ruin.</strong></em> You can cast the blight spell from the weapon (DC 15). Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destructive Ruin.</strong></em> You can cast the disintegrate spell from the weapon, but can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until dawn seven days later.</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> <em>Ruinblade</em> is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\r
<p>The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, <em>Ruinblade</em> also understands every language you know.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> <em>Ruinblade</em> speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.</p>\r
<p>The weapon’s purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate.

However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the <em>Infernal Machine</em> once functioned as this craft’s central command console.</p>\r
<p>Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. Yet with Lum’s eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Infernal Machine</em> is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Silver Wire.</strong></em> The <em>Infernal Machine’s</em> great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine’s inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.</p>\r
<p>As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the <em>Infernal Machine’s</em> powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut&mdash;something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection’s silvery cord&mdash;the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.</p>\r
<p>Any effect of the <em>Infernal Machine</em> that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The <em>Infernal Machine’s</em> effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user’s spell save DC, whichever is higher.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Summon Monster.</strong></em> When first used by Baron Lum, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:</p>\r
<p>1/day: conjure animals, summon lesser demons</p>\r
<p>1/7 days: conjure minor elementals, conjure woodland beings, summon greater demon</p>\r
<p>1/month: conjure elemental, conjure fey</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Wish.</strong></em> The <em>Infernal Machine</em> has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the <em>Infernal Machine</em> malfunctioning, necessitating seven days’ worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> There are far more possible combinations for the <em>Infernal Machine’s</em> controls than can ever be known or matrixed&mdash;especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the <em>Infernal Machine</em> Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.</p>\r
<p>Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user’s next long rest.</p>\r
<p>(Our thanks to the D&amp;D community for their suggestions for the properties of the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>!)</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Machine.</strong></em> The <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em> is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum’s time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings&mdash;and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the <em>Infernal Machine</em> to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.</p>\r

<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> <em>Will of the Talon</em> is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\r
<p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, and Infernal.</p>\r
<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A short-tempered bone devil named Ashtyrlon lives within <em>Will of the Talon</em>. The weapon is greedy and values strong leadership.

<h4>Dormant</h4>\r
<p>The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>You can speak, read, and write Draconic and Infernal.</li>\r
<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>\r
<li>As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
<li>While holding the war pick, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Pick a damage type from the <em>Will of the Talon</em> Breath Weapons table. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a DC 13 saving throw, the type of which is specified in the table. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>\r

<p>A shield guardian’s amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn’t being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.</p>\r

The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used <em>mythallars</em> to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the <em>mythallar</em>, the more magic it can hold. The largest <em>mythallars</em> are 150 feet in diameter.</p>\r
<p>The <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> is a relatively small device&mdash;a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this <em>mythallar</em>, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the <em>mythallar</em>. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> follows the attunement rules in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the <em>mythallar</em>, nothing happens.</p>\r
<p>All creatures attuned to the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The <em>Ythryn mythallar’s</em> properties are as follows:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>While you’re on the same plane of existence as the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em>, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.</li>\r
<li>As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can’t be recharged by the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.</li>\r
<li>You can use the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell’s casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> or the spell fails.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Touching the Mythallar.</strong></em> Any creature that touches the globe of the <em>mythallar</em> must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the <em>mythallar’s</em> cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).</p>`,index:1689},{name:"The Codicil of White",source:"Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden",canAttune:0,rarity:"Unknown Rarity",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/12735/208/637357088955779767.jpeg?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/12735/209/637357088959650197.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,price:500,description:`<p><em>The Codicil of White</em> is a tall, thin volume bound in white ermine fur over seasoned boards of white pine and sealed with a clasp and lock of tarnished silver.

These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle&nbsp;appears next to the mortar&nbsp;at the next dawn.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts">Artifacts</a>" section of the&nbsp;<em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></em>:</p>\r

</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Properties of the Mortar.</strong></em> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding&mdash;if there's enough space&mdash;up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Properties of the Pestle.</strong></em> The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r
<p>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Perfect Tools.</strong></em> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r
<p>You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Primal Parts.</strong></em> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Traverse the Night.</strong></em> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Bones Know Their Home.</strong></em> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p>\r

Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse&mdash;and the potential for future victory.

<p><em><strong>Iggwilv’s Curse.</strong></em> When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <em>Crook of Rao</em>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <em>Crook of Rao</em>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying or Repairing the Crook.</strong></em> The <em>Crook of Rao</em> can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.</p>`,price:-1,index:1716},{name:"Luba’s Tarokka of Souls",source:"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything",canAttune:1,rarity:"Artifact",isHomebrew:0,avatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/456/637411379801123719.png?width=350&height=350&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",largeAvatarUrl:"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/457/637411379803106177.png?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp",filterType:"Wondrous item",magic:1,description:`<p>Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter.

The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck’s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck.

Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Enduring Vision.</strong></em> While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.</p>\r

<p><strong>Mother Luba and the Vistani</strong></p>\r
<p>The creator of the <em>Tarokka of Souls</em>, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.</p>\r
<p>A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience&mdash;ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. &ldquo;We may wander amid the shadows,&rdquo; Mother Luba said. &ldquo;But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.&rdquo;</p>\r
<p>Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the <em>Tarokka of Souls</em>. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.</p>\r

Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it&mdash;and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p>\r
<p>Tales of the servant’s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the <em>Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. The best details on the device’s origins and operation can be found in the <em>Mind of Metal</em>, a tome of artificer’s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad’s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Dangerous Attunement.</strong></em> Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.</p>\r
<p>The servant’s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.</p>\r
<p>Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Controlling the Servant.</strong></em> While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster’s next turn.</p>\r
<p>A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.</p>\r
<p>While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li>\r
<li>Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li>\r
<li>As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li>\r
<li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Ghost in the Machine.</strong></em> Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM’s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p>\r
<p>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact&mdash; preferably using the servant, if possible.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Self-Destruct.</strong> </em>By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant’s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p>\r
<p>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p>\r
<p>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts&mdash;left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso&mdash; drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Servant.</strong></em> The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the <em>Machine of Lum the Mad</em>, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant’s self-destruct property.</p>`,price:-1,index:1720},{name:"Moon Sickle",source:"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything",canAttune:1,attunementDescription:"druid or ranger",rarity:"Varies",isHomebrew:0,filterType:"Weapon",magic:1,price:1500,description:`<p>This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight.

The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts">Artifacts</a>&rdquo; section of the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\r
<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\r
<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha’s hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges).</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Abyssal Reference.</strong></em> You can reference the <em>Demonomicon</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Fiendish Scourging.</strong></em> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Ensnarement.</strong></em> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Containment.</strong></em> The first 10 pages of the <em>Demonomicon</em> are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <em>Demonomicon’s</em> empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r
<p>When you finish a long rest, if you and the <em>Demonomicon</em> are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.</p>\r
<p>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Demonomicon.</strong></em> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, <em>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</em>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation for the <em>Demonomicon</em>.

They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Using the Teeth.</strong></em> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).</p>\r
<p>If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).</p>\r
<p>Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Sowing Teeth.</strong></em> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Implanting Teeth.</strong></em> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Recovering Teeth.</strong></em> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Teeth.</strong></em> Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Properties of the Pestle.</strong></em> The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\r
<p>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Properties of the Mortar.</strong></em> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding&mdash;if there's enough space&mdash;up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Traverse the Night.</strong></em> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Bones Know Their Home.</strong></em> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p>\r

The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes&mdash;eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability.

</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Gold Cauldron.</strong></em> The gold cauldron has the following properties:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.</li>\r
<li>If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn’t consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
<li>When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.</li>\r
<li>Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Iron Cauldron.</strong></em> The iron cauldron has the following properties:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn’t been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
<li>If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
<li>Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can’t recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again for 8 days.</li>\r
<li>If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn’s horn while reciting the poem called &ldquo;The Witch Queen’s Cauldron&rdquo; (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, doesn’t age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can’t be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn’s horn for 1 minute while reciting &ldquo;The Witch Queen’s Cauldron&rdquo; ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn’s horn.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Cauldron.</strong> </em>The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.</p>\r
<p>The destruction of <em>Iggwilv’s Cauldron</em> causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-h#Hags">Hag Covens</a>&rdquo; sidebar in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm"><em>Monster Manual</em></a>).</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Reconstructing the Cauldron.</strong></em> If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron’s reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.</p>\r

<li>If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>\r
<li>Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can’t recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again for 8 days.</li>\r
<li>If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn’s horn while reciting the poem called &ldquo;The Witch Queen’s Cauldron&rdquo; (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, doesn’t age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can’t be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn’s horn for 1 minute while reciting &ldquo;The Witch Queen’s Cauldron&rdquo; ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn’s horn.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Cauldron.</strong> </em>The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.</p>\r
<p>The destruction of <em>Iggwilv’s Cauldron</em> causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-h#Hags">Hag Covens</a>&rdquo; sidebar in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm"><em>Monster Manual</em></a>).</p>\r
<p><em><strong>Reconstructing the Cauldron.</strong></em> If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron’s reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.</p>\r

<p><em><strong>Exalted State.</strong></em> In this state, the jewel has received the blessing of Corellon the Arch Heart. A gleaming emerald surrounded by a halo of gold appears on the jewel.</p>\r
<p>The following benefits of the jewel improve:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>The bonus that the jewel confers to your AC increases to +3.</li>\r
<li>Its number of charges increases to 7.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p>The jewel gains the following additional properties, which you can use while wearing or holding it:</p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>You gain the ability to breathe water, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</li>\r
<li>Each of your allies within 30 feet of you gains the ability to breathe water and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.</li>\r
<li>As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the jewel’s charges to target yourself or one willing creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 15 feet of yourself, along with any equipment the target is wearing or carrying. The target appears in a flash of golden radiance, and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target’s new location must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.</li>\r

<p><strong>Attunement.</strong>&nbsp;Attunement takes ten days of possession. This means that as long as it is on one creature's person, in their bag (assuming they are holding the bag, but if they are not then it does not apply), or in their home for ten non-interrupted days, then the attunement will be complete. Once a creature is attuned, their face at the time the attunement occurs appears on the portrait. To end the attunement, the portrait must fall into another's possession until it is unattuned, or it must be destroyed. In the case that it is destroyed, a new one will appear in a random location by the DM's discretion.</p>\r
